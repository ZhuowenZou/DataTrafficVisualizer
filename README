12/29 Update:
	1. Data Trafic Visualizer now support configuration through user interface.
	2. the app.R can now detect the OS, thus the modification to app.R mentioned 
	in the original step in "How to run locally" & "How to deploy App to 
	shinyapp.io " is no longer needed.
	
Description
-----------
    This Application extracts info from log file to display a graph that
	represents the amount of bytes sent during a period of time

Mechanism
---------
	After the user starts the app from app.R or go to the webpage 
	(currently https://zhuowenzou.shinyapps.io/data_traffic_visualizer/), 
	a page will be prompted for user to upload the log file. The server in 
	app.R will call modifyConfig to create configuration file (config), then
	it'll call datParser.exe(WIN)/datParser.out(LINUX) to read in config 
	and to parse log file. The datParser will output temp.csv and stats.csv,
	which will be read in by app.R server to process and draw graph.
	
How to run locally
------------------
    Requirement: Rstudio
	Before running this program, make sure the following packages in Rstudio
	is installed:
		shiny, ggplot, gcookbook
	To run this program:
		1. Open app.R using Rstudio.
		2. Click "Run App"
		3. Follow the instructions on the popped page to create and interact with 
		the graph.
	
How to run on shinyapps.io
------------------
	Go to webpage https://zhuowenzou.shinyapps.io/data_traffic_visualizer/. Follow 
	the instruction on the popped page to create and interact with the graph.
	
How to deploy App to shinyapp.io 
--------------------------------
	Requirement: Rstudio
	Before running this program, make sure the following packages in Rstudio
	is installed:
		shiny, rsconnect.
		
	Also make sure that the following files are in the main directory 
	(Since the server runs on Linux, executable for WIN is optional):
		1. app.R
		2. datParser.out
		3. modifyConfig.out
		4. DeployRApp.R
		
	To deploy the App onto your account:
		1. Open DeployRApp.R and run through the script.
		2. The app should be appearing on your account upon success

Additional Info
---------------
	1. Both datParser.exe and datParser.out are built from src/datParser.cpp.
	You're more than welcome to modify it. The same goes for modifyConfig.
	2. Examples of the input and intermediate files (temp.csv stats.csv) is 
	Included as [filename]-example.[filetype]
	3. for Local user: directly modifying the configuration in config will not
	change the outcome, as the user interface will always reset it to default.
	To change the default configuration, please make modification to app.R.
